            <p style="text-indent:25px;">After nearly a decade in the mortgage industry, certain realities became quite apparent to me.  Most consumers don’t understand how the mortgage process works.  Furthermore complicating the issue, is that most mortgage brokers, loan officers, and executives don’t understand how the mortgage process works (yes, them too).  Or in some cases they are unable to comprehend loan guidelines.
            <p style="text-indent:25px;">Over the years I used my technical knowledge to find a better way to reach out to as many customers as I could.  My favorite clients typically ended up being fellow mortgage brokers in the industry.  They thought they stuck in their current programs, or couldn’t purchase a new home, or even an investment property.  Like all my other customers I educated them about some of the options out there, even if wasn’t an option that I could provide.
            <p style="text-indent:25px;">I worked alongside many of the best, and befriended many others.  Some of these mortgage brokers were overwhelmingly capable of providing a mortgage experience that would leave any customer breathing a sigh of relief.  Others, were possibly borderline capable of filling out your application correctly.
            <p style="text-indent:25px;">I felt it was time to apply my technical skills elsewhere.  However, I still wanted to reach out to customers, but this time I wanted to offer more of my insights, and now my connections.
            <p style="text-indent:25px;">I have had the pleasure of meeting some of best mortgage loan brokers in the industry.  I know the mortgage market down to the microscopic level.  I would like to share not only my connections, but also a look inside the mortgage industry about rates, guidelines, and unknown loan programs.  Specifically the Doctor Loan...</p>
