Article.create(title: 'Sink or Swim', content: '<p class="lead">Don’t worry if your property is underwater.  There is an estimated 3.2 million homeowners that still underwater.  I don’t like to bash the politicians for the uneven recovery, considering economists were yelling the sky was falling in 2008.  It’s plausible things could\'ve been considerably worse. I would like to ask why though?  Let’s ponder this one for few..
                </p> <p>During “The Great Recession” corporations (particularly lenders with toxic mortgage debt) failed left and right.  While other corporations saw it as an opportunity get bad debts off the books, including bloated salaries and what they considered extra personnel.  This shrinking of the corporations makes emulates exactly what the government did (precisely after a few huge spending measures to get the economy out of free fall).  So what did the consumer do?  They got the hint and followed in the exact same steps.  Saving increased dramatically and spending reduced (in addition to significant less spending from the newly unemployed).  So where does that leave us now?  The government, well maybe not the government, but the corporations are leaner, meaner, much more efficient machines.  The consumers want to do less with more, much like the corporations, but their expenses have only increased (due to quite mild inflation, despite all the Feds measures).  This has created a concentration of wealth, and geographically this wealth is centered in metropolitan areas.  Because this is where the corporations reside.  This creates strong housing demand for these areas, but outside of these areas, where few corporations exist, there is no demand, and little rise in the housing values.</p>
                <p>How do we fix this?  Good question.  In my glory days as a mortgage broker, I did literally thousands of refinances with the Making Home Affordable Program, or HARP, or even HASP.  I was churning them out before they even had a name.  A little background about the program is that if you pay your mortgage on time, we don’t care about your credit right now, we don’t care about your home value, and we don’t need to directly verify your exact amount of income.  But, I learned all too often that customers alot of times could not take advantage of this program because of lender creating guideline overlays.  To prevent them from refinancing a debt that they already settled on from prior 2009 lending.. Let\'s call it “mishaps.”  Old money is worth more than new money in those cases, or that is how I read their maneuvers.</p>
                <p>However, there was one more catch.  The investor on the mortgage had to be either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.  Why cause this program was a government initiative and due to the market crash, the government has full ownership of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  They were quasi private-government owned prior to the crash.  But when the boat started sinking, they had no choice but to send them a life-line, or global economic collapse, just might have been on the agenda.  This seems like a small criteria to overcome considering Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac are investors on more than 90 percent of mortgage originations today.  But remember, during the boom, everyone was trying to make.  Prior to 2009, roughly 60 percent of originations had Fannie or Freddie as the investor.   That is a 30 percent differential.  There were countless times that I would come across a customer who did everything right, but due to their home value they were stuck in an 8 percent interest rate.  Why?  Because they simply had the wrong investor to take advantage of the program.</p>
                <p>Now with the concentration of wealth, mild inflation, lack of consumer mechanisms to resolve exuberant debt, you can start to understand the uneven recovery not only across the whole economy, but specifically in home prices.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, I am of the opinion that it is coming quite apparent that it will take the economic boom, to revitalize housing prices where there hasn’t been much of gain.  It will most likely need to be big enough to rebuild the middle class.

Article.create(title: 'Rates in Free Fall', content: '<p class="lead">Most consumers believe interest rates (i.e. in this case mortgage rates) are directly tied to the fed funds rate.  This is a common misconception, but yet can be considered partially true.  One aspect of the mortgage market that is directly tied to the fed funds rate is home equity lines.  Banks closely align their prime rate with the Fed Funds rate.  The prime rate is typically extended to their least risky borrowers.  When you take out a home equity line it is typically the prime rate + their calculated risk to lending to you (add-on) and that will equal your interest rate on your line.</p><p>Now when it comes to your actual interest rate on say your typical 30 year mortgage it is much more complicated.  These interest rates are almost always based on the 10 year treasury bond yield.  In essence where the value of that bond is trending.  Despite the duration of these bonds being 10 years, this is considered more of a short term debt.  While the funds rate is considered much more long term.  We all remember the from the 1980’s into the early 2000’s when Alan Greenspan would be on television saying we are cutting the fed funds rate or increasing.  This was such a big deal because it stated what direction the economy was moving in the long term.</p><p>So where are mortgage rates going today?  This question in years past might of been easier to answer.  The uneven recovery globally, further complicated with how intertwined global economy is in this age, could make your guess as good as mine.  However, we do have some past indicators that could help us make an educated forecast.  We do have a few wildcards to deal first.  One being that is an election year, which means a lot of rhetoric that can drive the markets crazy.  But typically, between August and November of a Presidential election, you almost always see at least a 0.10 tick up in the 10 year year treasury.  Furthermore, consumer spending and borrowing usually increases at the end of the summer, as families gear up for another school year.  These reports are not usually available until later in the Fall and thus don’t affect the market immediately.  These two indicators would almost certainly indicate that we should be trending upwards at the moment.  But, we just hit a 3.5 year low with the 10 year treasury hitting 1.57 today (Tuesday June 14th.) </p><p>So what gives? There are a wide variety of factors, weak jobs report.  Fear of China banking crisis (weren’t they paying attention to the monster: our past housing market created?).  And the of course the continuous never ending question of the what the hell is going on with the Euro?<p>Given past history combined with the numerous negative market trends of current.  I think it is safe to assume that rates will stay near the bottom of historical lows for the very short-term.  And then trend upwards to mid-range historical lows late Summer to early Fall.  And from September to November is anyways guess with this election cycle.  I think you can expect rates to act erratic on a daily basis during that time period.  But over the long term after the election cycle ends, you can start expecting a steady upward trend towards the top of historical lows, if not further.</p>', img_path: 'rates_fall.png', article_route: '/mortgage-insights/articles/rates-in-free-fall', line_preview: 'Most consumers believe interest rates (i.e. in this case mortgage rates) are directly tied to the fed funds rate.', para_preview: 'Most consumers believe interest rates (i.e. in this case mortgage rates) are directly tied to the fed funds rate.

Article.create(title: 'Doctor Loan Part II', content: '<p class="lead">Most doctors when obtaining financing don’t understand that they have to go the traditional route.  Due to almost guaranteed contract employment along with above than median salaries, doctors have an advantage over your typical consumer.  Accompany that with the fact that statistically anyone with a graduate degree or higher (i.e. doctoral degree), is almost guaranteed to have higher wages and accumulate more liquid assets in their lifetime than professionals with less schooling; will cause the lender to come to the conclusion that “ a Lannister always pays his debts.”
                </p> <p>This low risk percentile is the reasoning behind the doctor loan.  Physicians can obtain more with less.  A standard home buyer looking for a mortgage above 417,000.00, might be forced to overcome hurdles such as 6 months liquid reserves (principal + interest + taxes + insurance payments), 20%\ minimum down payment, 740 minimum fico score, minimum two year work history at the same employer and position.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, a physician can apply for the very same loan amount and only be required to have 1 to 3 months reserves, 5%\ minimum down payment with NO private mortgage insurance, 720 minimum fico score, no work history ( 2 year education history can be used), as long as they provide proof they will be starting their employment within 60 days of the closing date of their loan.</p>
                <p>This is a tremendous advantage, that many medical professionals are completely unaware of.  Please feel free to leave any commentary or questions related to this program.  I will gladly try to answer any questions, or reveal further insight.</p>', img_path: 'news/doctor_article_show.jpg', article_route: '/mortgage-insights/articles/the-doctor-loan-part-II', line_preview: 'Most doctors when obtaining financing don’t understand that they have to go the traditional route.', para_preview: 'Most doctors when obtaining financing don’t understand that they have to go the traditional route.
